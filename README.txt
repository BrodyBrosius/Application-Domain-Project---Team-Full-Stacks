Mason Notes!
Hey! This is a friendly note from Mason! :)

Just an FYI - I will explain that the fs_accounting_app folder is the 'core' of our project. As we add more features, more directories will be added.

If you want to run the project yourself, do the following:

1) Clone the project to your desktop
2) Make sure Python 3.10.7 (latest) is installed
3) CD into the project folder and run: py manage.py runserver
4) Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser of choice.

These steps *should* work.
