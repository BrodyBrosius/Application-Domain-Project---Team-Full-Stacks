Hey! This is a friendly note from Mason! :)

Just an FYI - I will explain that the fs_accounting_app_core folder is the 'core' of our project. As we add more features, more directories will be added.

If you want to run the project yourself, do the following:

1) Clone the project to a folder on your computer from GitHub via your IDE of choice.
2) Make sure Python 3.10.7 (latest) is installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3) Make sure pipenv is installed (https://thinkdiff.net/how-to-use-python-pipenv-in-mac-and-windows-1c6dc87b403e).
3) CD into the folder called Application-Domain-Project---Team-Full-Stacks and run the following commands from a terminal:
    1) pipenv install
    2) pipenv shell
    3) py manage.py runserver
4) This should start the project and it should be viewable at this URL in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

These steps *should* work.
